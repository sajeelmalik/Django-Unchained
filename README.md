# Django Unchained

## Python

### Goals
Given an installation of Python 3.7, students should be able to:

- Declare and manipulate variables that take advantage of Python's "duck typing";

- Instantiate and populate lists and dictionaries;

- Use Python's basic conditional control structures to implement branching behavior; and

- Use Python's OO features to define classes and instantiate objects.

### Notes
This lesson provides cursory coverage of the language, and entails numerous omissions of essential concepts. These omissions are known and intentional. The point is that students should get enough to continue to experiment with the language. This will not be "most of the language". This is fine.
